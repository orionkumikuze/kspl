settup:
ram numb;
setting how big is ram.
reg numb;
setting amount of reg.
bit numb;
setting bits of alu;

possible usage:
ram 16;
reg 2;
bit 8;

alu operations:
- - subtract operation
+ - add operation
/ - division operation
* - multiplication operation
ram[numb] = output - giving output of alu to ram
reg[numb] = output - giving output of alu to reg
reg[numb] = reg[numb] operation reg[numb]
ram[numb] = ram[numb] operation ram[numb]
possible usage:
reg3 = reg1 + reg2
classes possible usage:
class Human {
   constructor(string name, int age) {
       this.name = name;
       this.age = age;
}}
stores variables
variables:
char[numb]; - stores characters
int; - stores numbers
bool; - stores false/true
console:
write - writes to console string
input - inputs keyboard from user
possible usage:
char[10] sos =  input;
write(sos);

jumps:
jump if(arg) [numb]; - jumps to line of code if argument is completed
jump [numb]; jumps to line of codes
possible usage:
0.write("what is your name");
1.char[10] name = input;
2.jump if(name=="sos") 0;

if statement:
if(arg) {} - do something if argument is completed
possible args:
reg[numb] == reg[numb]
!reg[numb]==reg[numb]
char name == "text";
int [name] == [numb];
[number] == [number]
char [name] == char [name]

ram and reg operations:
ram[numb] = reg[numb] - sets ram from reg;
reg[numb] = ram[numb] - sets reg from ram ;
